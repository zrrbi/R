# Crime Guns Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on improving public safety by tackling two key challenges: **Dealer Data Validation** and **Crime Gun Data Analysis**.

## **Note**
Due to the sensitive nature of this project, only a glimpse into the data scraping, analytics, and visualization process is provided here. 

## **Acknowledgments**
This project was completed during my fellowship with **Brady: United Against Gun Violence**, focusing on leveraging data science to improve public safety.
